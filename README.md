## Teemu

A small showcase of classic games and data science projects. All projects are Python-based. My ongoing (and finished) projects shown here include:

- ** Tic-Tac-Toe**: classic two-player turn-based game, made with Pygame. Supports two-player and single player modes for 3x3, 5x5 and 7x7 sized grids. Single player AI implements the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)
-  **Titanic Survivor Classification**: Uses logistic regression to predict if a passenger on Titanic survived the disaster. Also includes some descriptive statistics regarding the passenger data.  Dataset freely available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). Made in Jupyter notebook. *To be added*: trying out other ML models and their prediction rate
  - **(Not yet added) Blackjack**: classic casino card game made with PyGame. Contains graphical elements, single player only. Uses (unnecessary heavy-duty) SQLite database to store each player's earnings (each new player starts with a fixed amount and may continue playing later) and display 'high scores'. If a player's balance reaches 0, the run is over and they may start a new one. The database also tracks the amount of runs for each player. Future note & TD: Could include hashed login info to link accounts and earnings? Tables for earnings, account names & pw's.
