## Teemu

A random showcase of small games and data science projects. All projects are Python-based. My ongoing (and finished) projects include:

- **Blackjack**: classic casino card game made with PyGame. Contains graphical elements, single player only.
-  **Tick-Tac-Toe**: another classic. Supports two-player and single player modes. Single player AI implements the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)
-  **Titanic Survivor Classification**: A model that uses multiple machine learning algorithms to predict if a passenger on Titanic survived the disaster. Dataset freely available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
