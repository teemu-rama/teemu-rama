## Teemu

A small showcase of classic games and data science projects. All projects are Python-based. My ongoing (and finished) projects include:

- **Blackjack**: classic casino card game made with PyGame. Contains graphical elements, single player only. Uses (unnecessary heavy-duty) SQLite database to store each player's earnings (each new player starts with a fixed amount and may continue playing later) and display 'high scores'. Future note & TD: Could include hashed login info to link accounts and earnings? Tables for earnings, account names & pw's. 
-  **Tic-Tac-Toe**: another classic. Supports two-player and single player modes. Single player AI implements the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)
-  **Titanic Survivor Classification**: A model that uses multiple machine learning algorithms to predict if a passenger on Titanic survived the disaster. Dataset freely available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
